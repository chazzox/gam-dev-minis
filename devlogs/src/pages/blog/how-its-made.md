# A brief look into the technology behind this site

Much of this is oversimplified, don't expect a full explanation of everything. I
can't be bothered :)

## Markdown - What is a markdown language?

Imagine a normal word document, you have headers, hyperlinks, bold and italic text,
images and embedded sections of code. But in order to do all of this you need to use
the GUI and when you open a `.docx` file it looks like a mess.

```
docx file encoding
```

Markdown is kinda like a word document file, but instead of using the specialized
software, you can write all of the previously mentioned features in a 'code'

```md
# This is a header

## This is a sub header

### This is a sub sub header

[This is a link](http://example.com/)
![This is an image](https://picsum.photos/400/300)

bullet points...

-   **Bold text**
-   _Italic text_
```

As you can see, its pretty self explanatory. Because of its ease and simplicity, we
use markdown to write all of our blog posts.
