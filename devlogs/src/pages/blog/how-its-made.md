# A brief look into the technology behind this site

Much of this is oversimplified, don't expect a full explanation of everything. I
can't be bothered :)

## Markdown - What is a markup language?

Imagine a normal word document, you have headers, hyperlinks, bold and italic text,
images and embedded sections of code. But in order to do all of this you need to use
the GUI and when you open a `.docx` file it looks like a mess.

```docx

Markdown is kinda like a word document file, but instead of using the specialized
software, you can write all of the previously mentioned features in a 'code'

```md
# This is a header

## This is a sub header

### This is a sub sub header

[This is a link](http://example.com/)
![This is an image](https://picsum.photos/400/300)

bullet points...

-   **Bold text**
-   _Italic text_
```

As you can see, its pretty self explanatory. Because of its ease and simplicity, we
use markdown to write all of our blog posts. Markdown isnt the only markup language
out there, others like latex, restructured text and asciidoc are also popular.

## Svelte - What is a virtual dom library?

Before we understand what Svelte is, its worth understanding a little bit about how
websites are made these days. Before the days of react, vue, svelte and solidjs. Even
before the era of jquery. Websites were made using a combination of pure html, css
and some javascript. As the wants and needs of sites gre and expanded, so did the
complexity of the underling tools. After years of _(holy shit this part could be
long...)_

## Astro - What is a meta framework?

## All together now

### _We all live in a yellow submarine_

## Thats it... cya next time :))))
